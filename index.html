                    Why do people want to know what Math Kills means? What is it supposed to mean? I mean, I think I know what it means to me. It means that I need to be responsible with the math that I do. Because math can be used to hurt people or help people. But it's also more than that. I mean, yeah, there's that story about Hippasus and how he was murdered because of the math that he did. Man, now that I think of it, the math that I like is pretty counterculture. Everyone I am interested in was at one time or another a rebel, a blasphemer, or a odd duck. Thomas Bayes, William Gosset, Gerolamo Cardano, Regiomontanus. Math Kills is not mainstream. I don't think it's mainstream. It certainly isn't polished. I don't think I can ever really define what Math Kills is all about.

                    What do I like to do? What do I like to write about? Well randomness is an interesting subject. I really like probability. And not many people know that those two things are very distinct concepts. Probability is really just like a sandbox. It's an abstraction, kind of like a number. But instead of a fixed number it has this element of unpredictability to it. A number that keeps you on your toes. It takes some getting used to. Working with shifty numbers ain't a walk in the park. Unless it's a random walk in the park in which case I ask: what kind of random walk? Are we talking standard normal? If it's the stock market then it certainly isn't normal. It's more like a Levy distribution. Or if you're in a pinch and looking for something easier to work with, a Student's t might do the trick. But all of this dances around a fundamental question: what is random?

                <p>
                    What is random? Is the string of characters that I type random? Hardly. But my thoughts seem random. But what do I mean by that even? I guess I mean that I can't really predict where they're going or where they are going to end up. Like for instance, what am I going to write about next? I don't really know. This isn't a very crafted or edited paragraph that I'm writing. In a sense, a coin flipped a thousand times producing a thousand heads is a random outcome. Unlikely, but still random. As long as the coin isn't biased and there's all sorts of debates we could get into about that. So I guess what we're really dealing with is a psychological component. Maybe randomness is just our psychological interpretation of different probabilisitc outcomes.

                <p>
                    If randomness is psychological, then it would make sense that we could have very different feelings about different kinds of randomness. There's definitely different kinds of randomness. I mean, horoscopes are in a sense kind of random. But we have very particular feelings about how we experience randomness. The stock market is random, you could say, because it's unpredictable. But we experience a stock market crash very differently than a gradual descent into recession. Here is a puzzle worth thinking about: what makes us value randomness differently? That's a question I would like to know the answer to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish I knew the answer to so many questions. Where do numbers come from? Why do humans like alcohol? What makes music so pleasurable but noises bothersome? Maybe most importantly, I'd like to know why I chose to study math of all things? That might be the most random outcome of all.
