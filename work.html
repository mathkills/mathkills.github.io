                    I develop quantitative solutions for managers, designers, and engineers using rigorous modeling and experimentation. My expertise is in Bayesian econometrics with a focus on discrete choice models for conjoint and maxdiff analysis. In addition, I use adaptive experimental designs for A/B testing and recommendation models. Here are some projects I might work on:

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A company is re-evaluating their employee benefits package. They want to know which parts of the benefits package employees care about the most. A conjoint study is used to determine how employees trade-off hypothetical compensation packages and what drives their choices. This allows the company to offer benefits packages that provide maximal value to their employees at minimal cost.

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A regional financial institution wants to evaluate and track perceptions of their brand name relative to their competitors. A series of maxdiff studies are conducted periodically to learn regional perceptions of local financial institutions. A simulator is built to determine how these perceptions would change in response to a merger or acquisition.
                </div>
                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A beverage retailer wants to know how introducing a new product will impact their inventory management costs as well as customer's purchase decisions. A conjoint study is conducted to determine how much market share will be allocated to this new product when it is introduced. Sales transaction data are combined with the insights of the conjoint experiment to build a simulator that lets the retailer explore the optimal product lines that will lower inventory costs and increase revenue.

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A financial planning firm wants to tailor its fee structures and messaging to attract the right clients. A conjoint study measures the current client preferences for different services and fee structures offered by the firm. A follow up maxdiff study ranks a list of slogans and messaging campaigns based on perceptions of appeal, interest, and trustworthiness. Both studies incorporate demographic information which allows the firm to use the results to target their messaging and fee structures to better serve their ideal client.

                    A coffee chain is developing a new feature for their mobile application. They would like to develop personalized menus for users based on their previous purchase choices and evaluate the effectiveness of this feature. Working with the UX team, a prototype is developed for beta users that creates a personalized menu that continuously updates based on user's previous choices as well as the aggregate choices of customers using the standard mobile application. A follow-up maxdiff study is conducted to determine the ranking of this new feature relative to other features of the app.

                    I also teach workshops on how to do conjoint analysis, Bayesian statistics, data visualization, and software development for quantitative researchers. My instruction style is hands-on and based on examples, demonstrations, and case studies. Contact me if you'd like me to teach a workshop or consult on a project.

                    My Process
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Goals and Metrics: What are we trying to achieve? What role will analytics play? What metrics can we use to measure our progress? It's important to remember that mathematical models should never make important decisions for you. Ultimately, they are merely tools to help us humans make better decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cause and Effect Analysis: What aspects of the project are connected? In each of these connections, in which direction is the arrow of causality? By representing the business process as a causal diagram, we expose assumptions and hypotheses that can be tested through experimentation and analytics.
                <p>
                <p>
                    Pre-Data Simulation: Using the diagram created in the Cause and Effect Analysis, I build an interactive model that can simulate the problem. Together, we play the role of the scientist and tune the simulations to make sure that they accurately represent our beliefs about the way things might play out depending on the decisions we make. This calibrates our simulator to accurately reflect our business intuition and the decisions we might make in the absence of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data Collection and Experimentation: The simulator, now calibrated on our expectations before we see data, can now be used to generate good experimental designs that will inform the statistical model, pointing us in the directions where we will learn the most. This makes experimentation much more cost effective, allowing us to use precious resources to collect the data that will be most informative. Non-experimental or observational data can also be collected at this stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simulation with Data: The simulator is now updated to color our prior beliefs with data from the real world. Experimental data helps us tease out causal relationships between variables in our diagram and see how strong they are. Observational data helps to boost the experimental data to more accurately reflect reality. We can now use the simulator to explore parallel worlds and see how they've changed compared to the parallel worlds explored by the simulator before we had access to the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Summary and Conclusion: A report is given where diagnostics are given regarding how much confidence we can place in the computation of the simulator. Is it working? Does it produce realistic simulations? Are the simulations managerially significant (as opposed to statistically significant)? What have we learned? How well does this knowledge help us achieve our goals? The report includes lots of visualizations and summarizes the entire process. Finally the simulator is presented to management to be used as a tool for better decision making.
