                    I develop custom solutions for product managers, UX designers, and software engineers using the tools and experience I've acquired over the years. My expertise is in Bayesian econometrics with a focus on discrete choice modeling for conjoint and maxdiff analysis. In addition, I use adaptive experimental designs for A/B testing and recommendation models. Here are some projects I might work on:

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A company is re-evaluating their employee benefits package. They want to know which parts of the benefits package employees care about the most. A conjoint study is used to determine how employees trade-off hypothetical compensation packages and what drives their choices. This allows the company to offer benefits packages that provide maximal value to their employees at minimal cost.

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A regional financial institution wants to evaluate and track perceptions of their brand name relative to their competitors. A series of maxdiff studies are conducted periodically to learn regional perceptions of local financial institutions. A simulator is built to determine how these perceptions would change in response to a merger or acquisition.

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A beverage retailer wants to know how introducing a new product will impact their inventory management costs as well as customer's purchase decisions. A conjoint study is conducted to determine how much market share will be allocated to this new product when it is introduced. Sales transaction data are combined with the insights of the conjoint experiment to build a simulator that lets the retailer explore the optimal product lines that will lower inventory costs and increase revenue.

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A financial planning firm wants to tailor its fee structures and messaging to attract the right clients. A conjoint study measures the current client preferences for different services and fee structures offered by the firm. A follow up maxdiff study ranks a list of slogans and messaging campaigns based on perceptions of appeal, interest, and trustworthiness. Both studies incorporate demographic information which allows the firm to use the results to target their messaging and fee structures to better serve their ideal client.

                <div class="hypotheticals">
                    A coffee chain is developing a new feature for their mobile application. They would like to develop personalized menus for users based on their previous purchase choices and evaluate the effectiveness of this feature. Working with the UX team, a prototype is developed for beta users that creates a personalized menu that continuously updates based on user's previous choices as well as the aggregate choices of customers using the standard mobile application. A follow-up maxdiff study is conducted to determine the ranking of this new feature relative to other features of the app.

                    I am passionate about empowering people to make better decisions. That's why I also teach workshops about the methods that I use. I've taught how to do conjoint analysis in Stan, data visualization for Bayesian statistics, software development for quantitative researchers, and more. My instruction style is hands-on and based on examples, demonstrations, and case studies. Contact me if you'd like me to teach a workshop or consult on a project.
